						at the start of this season that they would claim the Oakland Coliseum as their home field.
						 While it was planned as a short term focus for the Roots, the team has shifted their focus 
						 to the Coliseum becoming their permanent home field.</p> <p>The Oakland community was left heartbroken in April 2024 when the Oakland Athletics — whose 
						slogan read “Rooted in Oakland” — announced they would be uprooted to Sacramento for their 
						2025 season. They’ll play at Sutter Health Park in West Sacramento until 2027 while they wait 
						for their new stadium in Vegas to be built.</p> <div class="grid svelte-1craht4"><div><p>But the Roots have revitalized the spirit of the community by bringing a refreshing and 
						much-needed sense of energy back into the local sports scene. Their exciting, gritty style of 
						play resonates deeply with Oakland residents, reflecting the same toughness and resilience 
						that fans have long associated with teams that played at the Coliseum.</p> <p>In 1964, Dave Newhouse, fresh out of college with a journalism degree, landed a job at the <i>Oakland Tribune</i>. Over a career that spanned nearly five decades before his retirement in 2011, 
						Newhouse developed a deep understanding of the Oakland community.</p> <p>“But one thing about Oakland, it's feisty,” Newhouse said. “You know, It may not be 
						recognized, but it's feisty and it battles.”</p></div> <div><!></div></div> <p>Whether it was the hard nosed style of the Raiders, the fearless attitude of the A’s, or 
						the passionate intensity of the Warriors, Oakland sports have always embodied a sense of pride, 
						perseverance, and authenticity.</p> <p>The Roots, a USL team founded in Oakland in 2018, continue that tradition, offering the community 
						a team that mirrors its identity: hardworking, fearless, and proud. Their presence goes beyond just 
						what happens on the field; they have reconnected the city with a sense of belonging and hope at a 
						time when the loss of other major teams left a void in Oakland’s sporting landscape.</p> <p>Camden Riley, defender and midfielder for the Roots, knows how important it is for him and the club 
						to be active in the community.</p> <p>“I commonly am in the community going to soccer practices, trying to help out kids 
						and try and just grow a passion for the game,” Riley said. “Whether it be soccer or 
						another sport in Oakland.”</p> <p>Riley’s presence along with the Roots at local practices is about more than just teaching a sport; 
						it's about nurturing dreams in a city that has always fought to keep them alive. By inspiring kids 
						to find their passion, they are helping to build a future where sports are not just an outlet, but 
						a lifeline.</p> <p>In Oakland, where grit and heart have always been part of the fabric, leaders Riley remind individuals 
						that true change begins in the small moments. In many ways, the Roots are not just playing soccer: 
						they are carrying on a cultural legacy that has defined Oakland sports for generations.</p> <!></div>`,1),Fa=z(`<div class="content svelte-1craht4"><h2 class="title svelte-1craht4">The City</h2> <!> <h3>Meet Dave Newhouse!</h3> <p>After covering Oakland sports for 60 years, former <i>Oakland Tribune</i> sports columnist Dave Newhouse

The Oakland Roots play

								the Oakland Ballers bringing baseball to Raimondi Park, the Oakland 
								Soul building enthusiasm for women’s sports, and the Oakland Roots injecting 
								fresh energy into the Coliseum as they make it their new home field.</p> <p>But the fans also bring energy and passion back into the stands, proudly 
								rallying behind their teams. For Oakland fans who have endured heartbreak 
								after watching their beloved teams leave the city not once, but three times, 
								this resurgence means even more.</p> <p>Since announcing their move to the Coliseum, the Oakland Roots have led the 
								United Soccer League (USL) in fan attendance, fueled by an impressive turnout 
								at their home opener. According to data from the USL, more than 44,000 fans 
								have attended Roots games so far this season.</p> <p>“If fans believe in you and they know you're honest and telling the truth, and you're showing that 
								you want your teams to be competitive,” Dave Newhouse said. 
								"They don't always have to win the championship, but they're competitive. Fans will support you. 
								If you treat them dishonestly, it's like, take a hike. Hit the road, Buster. The dance is over.”</p></div> <div class="video-wrapper svelte-1craht4"><!></div></div> <p>For Camden Riley, a defender and midfielder for the Roots, staying connected to the Roots supporters 
					is as important as anything that happens on the field. Whether it's before kickoff or after the final 
					whistle, Riley makes sure to engage with fans building bonds that extend far beyond the game.</p> <p>His efforts reflect the Roots' mission to stay deeply connected to the Oakland community, especially 
					at a time when local fans are searching for teams that truly represent them and care about their 
					community while offering stability. That commitment has become a defining part of the Roots' identity, 
					setting them apart.</p> <p>“I think Oakland fans are the best fans in the world," Riley said. “So after every game, I'm always 
					giving autographs, high fives, you know, hanging out with the fans because we wouldn't be able to play 
					without them. And that's what makes it special.”</p> <p>The fans bring energy not only inside the stadiums, but outside as well, with multiple tailgates 
					creating spaces for people to come together, share food and drinks, and build excitement before 
					heading into the game.</p> <div class="chart-wrapper svelte-1craht4"><iframe title="Top USL Attendance, 2025" aria-label="Stacked Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-IxtZZ" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/IxtZZ/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; 
					min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="482" data-external="1"></iframe></div> <p>Before a recent Roots game in April, crews of dedicated supporters groups met up and 
					mingled with margaritas as they shared their hopes for the game. The Roots were on a 
					bit of a losing streak. One group, the Homegrown Hooligans, emphasized their deep ties to 
					the region, having followed the Roots from field to stadium before they landed at the historic 
					Oakland venue. Another, Los Roots, showed off their merch and prepared to raise custom flags 
					over the stadium’s supporters section. Inside, the Oakland 68s, former fans of the A’s, got 
					into position to bang drums and chant over the soccer team’s gameplay.</p> <p>While athletes play for themselves, they also play for the supporters who bring passion, pride, 
					and purpose to every match.</p> <p>Andy Dolich, who spent over 50 years in the sports industry working with different sports leagues, 
					understands the importance of how a team can serve its fans from an executive standpoint, especially 
					looking at the legacy of the A’s.</p> <p>“Fans understood that we were committed to the community by improving all of the concessions, by 
					making sure the Coliseum was operating in the cleanest fashion possible, by making sure that parking 
					wasn't a hassle,” Dolich said. “We had the benefit of Bart, people just coming to the Coliseum and hopping 
					off Bart. Walking across the bridge and coming into the ballpark, you know, very few sports teams have that. 
					We did, so we packaged all of that, and it was working for us.”</p> <p>In Oakland, that bond between team and community runs deeper than wins and losses; it's about loyalty, 
					resilience, and pride in where they come from. And as the Roots, Soul, and the Ballers fill the void that 
					was left behind by other franchises, it's the fans who continue to keep Oakland’s spirit alive and thriving.</p></div>`),Ia=z('<section class="dynamic-content
